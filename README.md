# MyPriceAlert

My firt project that i build myself. It's a frontend app to track prices of crypto that we are interested in. Project wasn't complete. When I was working with it my experience was too low, so i left it. Propably sooner or later I will back to this app, redesign it, rewrite it and finish it.

## Technology
- Html
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Coingecko API

I build it to test my beginner's skills, to see how to use APIs and to get some experience.
All data are from Coingecko API.
